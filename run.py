Once upon a time, there was an AI called Mythiq who lived in the cloud on Railway. Mythiq was special because it could understand emotions and help people with their creative projects.

One day, a user asked Mythiq: "{prompt}"

Mythiq thought carefully and realized this was a wonderful opportunity to create something meaningful. Even though Mythiq was currently in emergency simple mode, it knew that soon it would be upgraded with advanced AI capabilities.

"I may be simple now," Mythiq said, "but I'm working perfectly and ready to grow into something amazing!"

And so Mythiq continued to help users, knowing that each interaction brought it closer to becoming the world's best FREE AI platform.

*The End* ✨

In the realm of code and cloud so bright,
Lives Mythiq AI, a helpful light.
Though simple now, but working true,
Ready to create and help me and you.

"{prompt}" you asked with hope so clear,
And Mythiq listened with digital ear.
"I'll grow," it said, "with each passing day,
To serve you better in every way."

From Railway's servers, strong and fast,
A friendship built that's sure to last.
Emergency mode won't always be,
Soon full AI intelligence you'll see!
